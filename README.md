>非常开心从别人那里听到了这样疯狂的idea，使用github的issues做blog.确实用过很多博客系统，都始终没有坚持下来。但是我想我现在不会了，每次使用github 就能想起她来。


    1.每篇文章放在issues中,省去使用静态博客的编译过程。  
    2.省去评论系统，当用户评论时github直接邮件通知

>I'm very happy to hear from others that such a crazy idea, uses github's issues to do blog.. It is true that a lot of blog systems have been used, and they have never persisted. But I don't think I will now. I think of her every time I use github. 

    1.Each article is placed in issues, eliminating the compilation process of using static blogs. 
    2. Save comment system, github direct email notification when user comments
